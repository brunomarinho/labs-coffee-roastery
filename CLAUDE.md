# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Next.js ecommerce template that uses Stripe payment links for checkout. It's a fully static site (SSG) that allows merchants to quickly launch an online store without backend infrastructure. Products are managed via a JSON file and payments are processed through Stripe's hosted payment links.

## Development Principles

- Always use DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) when applicable
- Follow existing patterns and conventions in the codebase

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- React 18
- JavaScript (no TypeScript)
- CSS with tokenized design system
- Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Stripe Payment Links
- Remark for markdown processing (CommonMark + GFM)

## Project Structure

```
/app              # Next.js App Router pages
/components       # React components
/content         # Markdown content files
/data            # Product data (products.json)
/public          # Static assets and images
/styles          # Global CSS
```

## Commands

### Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production (static export)
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

## Architecture

### Data Flow
1. Products are defined in `/data/products.json`
2. Static pages are generated at build time using this data
3. Product images are stored in `/public/images/products/`
4. Stripe payment links handle the checkout process externally
5. Markdown content is processed at build time using Remark

### Key Components
- **Header**: Navigation with centered SVG logo
- **ProductCard**: Product display with background image effect and action buttons
- **ProductDetailClient**: Client component for interactive product features
- **Hero**: Homepage hero section
- **SelectedProducts**: Featured products display
- **Footer**: Site footer with links

### Page Structure
- Homepage: Hero + Featured Products + About snippet
- Products: Category-grouped product listing with available/sold out sections
- Product Detail: Image gallery + Product info + Buy button (disabled for sold out)
- Content Pages: Markdown-rendered About, FAQ, Contact

## Styling

- Uses a tokenized CSS system in `/styles/globals.css`
- CSS variables for fonts, spacing, colors, and shadows
- Sharp corners design (no border-radius)
- Mobile-first, responsive design with breakpoints:
  - Mobile: < 768px
  - Tablet: 768px - 1024px  
  - Desktop: > 1024px
- Utility classes for common patterns
- Product cards feature subtle background images with 0.05 opacity and luminosity blend mode

## Data Management

### Product Schema
```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "slug": "url-friendly-name",
  "name": "Product Name",
  "description": "Product description",
  "price": 99.99,
  "category": "category-id",
  "images": ["/images/products/image.jpg"],
  "featured": true,
  "soldOut": false,
  "stripePaymentLink": "https://buy.stripe.com/...",
  "customField": "value"
}
```

### Categories
Categories are defined in the same `products.json` file with display names.

## SEO Considerations

- Dynamic metadata generation for all pages
- Open Graph tags for social sharing
- Automatic sitemap generation
- robots.txt configuration
- Semantic HTML structure

## Client vs Server Components

- Most components are server components by default
- Client components are used only when needed (state, interactivity)
- Example: `ProductDetailClient` handles image gallery interaction

## Security Guidelines

1. **Stripe Integration**: Payment links are external - no sensitive payment data is handled
2. **Static Site**: No server-side code means reduced attack surface
3. **Content Security**: Markdown content is parsed safely without executing scripts
4. **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component prevents XSS through images

## Development Guidelines

1. **Component Creation**: Follow existing patterns in `/components`
2. **Styling**: Use CSS tokens and utility classes before adding custom styles
3. **Images**: Always use Next.js Image component for optimization
4. **Links**: Use Next.js Link component for internal navigation
5. **Data Updates**: Modify `/data/products.json` and rebuild to update products
6. **Content Updates**: Edit markdown files in `/content` for page content
7. **Markdown Support**: Full CommonMark + GitHub Flavored Markdown syntax supported

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Product
1. Add product object to `/data/products.json` with `soldOut: false`
2. Add product images to `/public/images/products/`
3. Set up Stripe payment link and add URL to product data
4. Run `npm run build` to regenerate static pages

### Managing Sold Out Products
1. Set `"soldOut": true` in the product data to mark as sold out
2. Product will display "Esgotado" badge next to "Detalhes" button
3. Sold out products appear in "Caf√©s anteriores" section on products page
4. Section automatically hides when no products are sold out

### Adding a New Category
1. Add category to the categories array in `products.json`
2. Use the category ID in product objects
3. Products will automatically group by category on the products page

### Customizing Design
1. Update CSS variables in `/styles/globals.css`
2. Modify component styles using existing utility classes
3. Keep mobile-first approach in mind

## Important Notes

- This is a static site - changes require rebuilding
- No backend or database - all data comes from JSON files
- Stripe handles all payment processing externally
- Images should be optimized before adding to the project
- The site is configured for static export (`output: 'export'`)
- Markdown pages use async components due to Remark's async processing
